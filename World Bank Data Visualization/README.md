# Exercise 3

In this exercise, you'll practice using scales, margins, and axes for displaying data visualizations. In particular, you will be creating a **scatter plot** illustrating the [Gross Domestic Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product) vs. the [Life Expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy) of different countries, using data from the [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators).

You can see the results of your work by running a local webserver in this directory:

```
cd /path/to/exercise
python -m http.server
```

And viewing the page at <http://localhost:8000>. Be sure to also check the [Developer Console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/).
