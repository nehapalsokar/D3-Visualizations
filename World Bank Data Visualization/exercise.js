//Use the SVG_SIZE and MARGIN_SIZE values to calculate the `width` and `height`

//Define an `async` function called `createPlot()`, which will load the data and
//create the plot, following the below instructions:


    //First, use the `d3.csv()` function to load the `data/WDI_2014_cleaned.csv`
    //file (make sure to `await` for it to finish).

    
    //Log out the data once it is received to confirm that it is loaded correctly.

    
    //Calculate the minimum and maximum values for the `life_expectancy` and `gdp`
    //columns in the data. Hint: use `d3.min()` and `d3.max()`. You will need to
    //use `parseFloat()` to convert String values into numbers
    //Log out the values to test them.
    //(GDP goes from ~152 to ~82923, LE from ~49 to ~84)

    
    //Create a scale for the y values. This should be a _linear_ scale whose 
    //domain is the data's life expectancy values, and whose range is the height
    //of the displayable area.
    //NOTE: your range will need to go from the `height` to 0 (so that the axis 
    //is "inverted")

    
    //Create a scale for the x values. This should be a _logarithmic_ scale whose
    //domain is the data's GDP values, and whose range is the width of the
    //displayable area.

    

    //Append a <g> element in which to place the plotted circles
    //Use the `transform`, `width`, and `height` attributes to size this
    //based on the MARGIN and displayable dimensions
    //Save this element as the `plot`.

    
    //Select all of the <circle> elements in the `plot` group (there are none
    //initially) and join them with the loaded data.

    
    //Append a new circle for each entering element, with the following attributes:
    //  `cx` (center-x) of the country's `gdp` scaled by the x-scale
    //  `cy` (center-y) of the country's `life_expectancy` scaled by the y-scale
    //  `r` (radius) of 10
    //  `fill` that is 'blue'
    //  `opacity` of 0.3 (use the `style()` method!)


    //Define an bottom axis for the x-scale. Give it 5 tick mark values 
    //using `'.0f'` as a format option (integers)

    
    //Append a <g> element to the svg to contain the xAxis. Use the `transform`
    //attribute to `translate()` the element to below the display area.
    //Then `call()` the x-axis to add it to the visualization

    
    //Define a left axis for the y-scale. Give it `tickFormat()` of 
    //`d3.format('.2s')` (2 digits with SI prefixes)

    
    //Append a <g> element to the svg to contain the yAxis. Use the `transform`
    //attribute to `translate()` the element to the left of the display area.
    //Then `call()` the y-axis to add it to the visualization

    

    //BONUS: Add <text> elements as the axis titles!

    

    //Remember to call your `createPlot()` function to show the plot!
